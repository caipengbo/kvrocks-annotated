# How to write commit message 

1. Should start with prefix DOC|TST|MOD|ADD|FIX and then colon
2. Present-tense summary under 50 characters
3. Add issue number if exists

For exmple:

```
FIX: remove unnecessary lines in readme. Fixes #12

* More information about commit (under 72 characters)  
* More information about commit (under 72 characters)
```

Thanks!
